#BookShare
Our aim is to provide a platform for people to share books with their peers. People make new friends, by meeting people who like reading similar books. Authentic information of user is necessary for the success of this app, and this is enforced by the community. Annonymity is provided to the lender by not showing his information when a person searches for a book. Lender gets the information about the person requested for the book, based on which he can choose to accept or reject the requests

###Buisness Plan
  1. Finding the right people to launch the app is important, as the initial members play a huge part in moderation and content generation. So we plan to launch it in colleges and allow only institution wise search in the beginning and once it reaches a bigger scale we would include a distance based search along with institution wise search.
  2. Content generation is very important. We want more users to login and stay on our web app for a long time. To achieve this we provide them with a feature where they will get to write a book. This will be published on the site along with upvote and downvote buttons. The visibility of the books written by the community follows a hierarchical structure, if it has upvotes in the local area then it will be globally visible. If everything works perfectly, this might be the new place authors prefer to publish their material and they get paid for their invaluable work.
  3. Reviews to books. There will not be a better community to write reviews on books than this. It's important to let people express their thoughts on the book they have just recieved
  
###Features to be implemented which are essential for the success of the app

  1. Rating : Every user will be given a rating which denotes the trust and activity a user has on the BookShare app. This is very esssential as this is the sole thing a person will see while requesting for the book. There will also be a leaderboard which shows the users that are loved by the community. 
  2. A good platform for writers with version control to write their content
  3. A feed for every user where they can read the books written by their peers and globally acclaimed authors. 
  4. Anonymity of the book owners until they accept the requests (this is partially implemented already)
